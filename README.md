## Description
MySQL burger logger app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat. When a user submits a burger name, it will display on the left side of the page, waiting to be eaten. Each burger in the waiting area has an "Eat it" button, that when clicked, will move the burger to the right side of the page.
